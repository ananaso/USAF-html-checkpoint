HTML Checkpoint on SDI Learn

## Project instructions
- Recreate the GMDB webpage (sample images below) from scratch using raw HTML and CSS
- The images provided should guide your design
- The webpage has, as you'll see a login page (when you first arrive), a top navigation bar, a browse display of multiple movies and if an individual movie is clicked on, its details and a Leave a comment feature are displayed.
- Do your best to implement those 4 features using what you have learned about HTML and CSS.
- Feel free to use outside resources if you need assistance with syntax for HTML or CSS.
- This is a purely visual exercise, do not worry about data/content - feel free to hardcode movie data to make things look operational.
